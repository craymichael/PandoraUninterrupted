# Pandora Uninterrupted
This {tamper,grease}monkey script gets rid of those pesky "Still Listening" messages that interrupt listening. In tandem with an adblocker, an uniterrupted Pandora listening experience is created. This does not prevent sign up popups.
Working as of May 2017.

# Installation
To install this script, you will need Greasemonkey if you are running Mozilla FireFox, otherwise Tampermonkey for Google Chrome.
Following, you can acquire the script by cloning the repository using git, otherwise you can download the file through the GitHub interface. Through git you can download using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/craymichael/PandoraUninterrupted.git
```
To install the file, you will need to do one of the following.
#### Greasemonkey
You may drag and drop the file into the browser to install it. Otherwise, open up "Manage user scripts" under the monkey icon. Under the settings (gear icon), select "Install script" and select "PandoraUniterrupted.user.js". It may need to be enabled once installed.

#### Tampermonkey
1. Open up the Tampermonkey dashboard.
2. Under the "Utilities" tab, click "Choose Fiile" under the "File" section.
